Certainly! Let's go through the code line by line, explaining each part and its purpose:

### Environment Configuration

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```
- **Load Environment Variables**: This loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This is useful for managing configuration settings like database connection strings and secret keys.

### Module Imports

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const path = require('path');
const emailRoutes = require('./routes/emailRoutes');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser'); 
const connectDB = require('./db'); 
const session = require('express-session');
const connectMongo = require('connect-mongo');
```
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs.
- **bodyParser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies, making it easier to handle form submissions and JSON payloads.
- **path**: Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- **emailRoutes**: Custom module for handling email-related routes.
- **mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **cookieParser**: Middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request object.
- **connectDB**: Custom module to connect to the MongoDB database.
- **session**: Middleware to handle session management.
- **connectMongo**: MongoDB session store for `express-session`.

### Initialize Express App

```javascript
const app = express();
```
- **Create Express Application**: Initializes an Express application instance.

### Connect to MongoDB

```javascript
connectDB();
```
- **Database Connection**: Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the custom `connectDB` module.

### Middleware for Parsing Cookies

```javascript
app.use(cookieParser());
```
- **Cookie Parsing**: Parses cookies attached to the client request object, making them available in `req.cookies`.
- **Note**: `cookieParser` is useful but not strictly necessary for session management with `express-session` since `express-session` can handle cookies by itself. However, if you need to access or manipulate cookies directly, you will need `cookieParser`.

### Middleware for Parsing Request Bodies

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```
- **JSON Parsing**: `bodyParser.json()` parses JSON formatted request bodies.
- **URL-encoded Parsing**: `bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })` parses URL-encoded request bodies, which are typically used in form submissions.

### View Engine Setup

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
```
- **View Engine**: Sets EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine.
- **Views Directory**: Specifies the directory where template files are located.

### Serve Static Files

```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads')));
```
- **Static Files**: Serves static files from the `public` directory.
- **Uploads Directory**: Serves files from the `uploads` directory at the `/uploads` URL path.

### Configure Session Middleware with connect-mongo

```javascript
app.use(session({
    secret: '123', // Replace with a strong secret key
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: { maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 }, // 24 hours
    store: connectMongo.create({
        mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI,
        collectionName: 'sessions', // Collection name for storing sessions
    }),
}));
```
- **Session Middleware**: Configures session management with `express-session`.
  - **secret**: A secret key used to sign the session ID cookie. It should be a strong, random value in a real application.
  - **resave**: If false, the session will not be saved back to the session store unless it was modified during the request.
  - **saveUninitialized**: If false, a session will not be created until something is stored in it.
  - **cookie**: Configures the session cookie's properties, such as its maximum age (1 day in this case).
  - **store**: Configures the session store, in this case using `connect-mongo` to store sessions in MongoDB.

### Use Email Routes

```javascript
app.use(emailRoutes);
```
- **Email Routes**: Mounts the email routes defined in `emailRoutes`. These routes handle email-related HTTP requests.

### Export the Express App

```javascript
module.exports = app;
```
- **Export Application**: Exports the Express application instance for use in other parts of the application, such as the server entry point.

### Summary

- **Environment Configuration**: Loads configuration settings from `.env`.
- **Middleware Setup**: Configures various middleware for parsing cookies, request bodies, serving static files, and handling sessions.
- **Session Management**: Uses `express-session` with `connect-mongo` to manage user sessions and store them in MongoDB.
- **Route Handling**: Includes custom routes for handling email-related requests.

### Do We Need `cookieParser`?

- **Not Strictly Necessary**: For session management alone, `cookieParser` is not strictly necessary because `express-session` handles cookies internally.
- **Useful for Direct Access**: If you need to read, manipulate, or set cookies directly outside of session management, `cookieParser` is useful and often included for convenience.
